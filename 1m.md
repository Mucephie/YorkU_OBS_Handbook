# Basic 1m Telescope Operations 
1. Open the dome leaving the drop down shutter in the “down” position (unless you are 
sure that low altitude viewing is needed). To raise the “upper” shutter ONLY, pull down on the rope to the right of the shutter while the “upper” shutter is activated and raised. 
2. Turn on the telescope (lever on telescope base) and remove the two covers: baffle and 
secondary mirror. 
3. If imaging, turn on the CCD camera power bar on the base of the telescope, and remove 
its cover. Ensure everything is clear of the telescope. 
4. Check to make sure the two emergency stop switches are not engaged. 
5. On Milky Way, open the “Plane Wave Shutter Control” program in the taskbar. Make sure to use the most recent version. Connect “Comm 3”, and open the shutters (4 petals). **When the temperature is BELOW freezing** you may need to disable the 
current limit for the shutters, to do this, after a new power on, inside the Shutter Control window: 
*Select TOOLS *Select Low-Level Control *Select Option Disable Current Limit → you should now see the numbers at the bottom update to 00 00 01 -note that in this mode the actuators have the potential to damage the telescope or themselves so only use in COLD conditions and make sure the telescope is CLEAR. 
6. Open the “Plane Wave Interface” (PWI for short) in the taskbar. In the “Mount” tab, 
connect to the telescope. Click “Enable Az” and “Enable Alt” to be able to remote control the telescope’s azimuth and altitude motors.. 
7. In the M3 (third mirror) tab, go to your desired port. The port currently in use will be 
green and say “Port x active”. To change ports, click the port you would like to go to. For visual observing, go to Port 2. For astrophotography, go to Port 1. 
8. For visual observing (PV and tours), the telescope is sufficiently connected. Proceed to 
the next section. For astrophotography, additional setup is required. 
9. In the “Focus” tab, enable the focuser for Port 1. 10. Enable the derotator for Port 1 in the “Rotate” tab. 11. In the “Fans” tab turn on all fans. This will cool all the mirrors to the ambient 
temperature, improving the seeing, which is important for quality viewing. 

## Navigating the Sky 
1. Thanks to the telescopes absolute encoders it always knows where it is pointing, and 
nightly alignments are not necessary. Once the telescope is connected, it is ready to be driven anywhere in the night sky. The location where the telescope is pointing is represented by the green circle with crosshairs in the “Sky Viewer” tab on the right of PWI. 
2. The Sky Viewer contains some (but not all) objects in the sky. If a desired target appears 
in Sky Viewer, click on it, and press “Go To”. The telescope will then slew to the target, and start tracking. **Be sure to warn anyone on the platform that the telescope is about to move.** To go to objects that do not appear in Sky Viewer, there are two options. Click “Find Targets” under the View menu, and search for your object. If your object cannot be found, use a program such as Stellarium to find the RA and Dec of your object, enter these values into Find Targets, and Go To. (Normally you will select J2000 coordinates.) The same thing can be accomplished by using the “Go To” tab on the right of PWI. When slewing, always make sure you can click on “Stop” button quickly if needed. 
3. You can tell how well the telescope is tracking by looking at the values of “Axis 0 RMS” (Azimuth) and “Axis 1 RMS” (Altitude). While tracking, these values should be between 0.07 and 0.25. The telescope has a built in “Hard Stop”, so will not go to certain altitudes (near to the horizontal or the horizon). If you selected an object lower than its hard stop, the telescope will not go to it, and you will see Axis 1 RMS have very high values. Drive to another object if this happens. 
4. On the dropdown portion of the telescope, there is a yellow cord that will hang from the dome when the drop down section is up. This cord is located at the perfect height to bump into the secondary mirror, which could damage it. When you must bring up the drop down section, pay careful attention to the location of this rope to avoid hitting the secondary mirror. 
5. A Logitech Joystick controller can be used to manually move the telescope in RA and Dec. To use it, go into the View menu, click Joystick Controller, and enable Enable movement with joystick. Then click the Logitech button on the front of the controller. Change the Slow Vel to 0.05 deg/s, and use the bottom left nob to move the telescope. If a faster speed is desired, press the RB button on the front right of the controller to slew at the Fast vel speed. Be cautious as to what value Fast vel is set to. You don't want to lose control of the telescope. The default of 2 deg/sec should be sufficient. 

## Using the CCD 
1. On the Desktop, there is a “Astrophotography” folder. In this folder, create a nights directory with the following format: 2019-08-16+17. It is good practice to create additional folders for your flats, darks and lights, and to separate your light images into different folders for different objects, and possibly different filters. 
2. Take the 1 m Log Book from within the warm room and record the date, along with who was observing. Use it to take note of when images were taken, through what filter, and at what exposure. 
3. Currently, two programs will be used to control the CCD: MaxIm DL and TheSkyX. Maxim DL connects to PWI to allow for autofocusing, and TheSkyX will be used to take your images. You will start the night out by using TheSkyX to take your flats and biases. In TheSkyX, go to the “Camera” section, and connect to the “SBIG STX Cameras”. Set the temperature to -35 degrees below ambient. In the “Filter Wheel” section, connect to the “SBIG auto CFW” filter wheel. 
4. Back in the Camera section, you’ll find 3 tabs: Take Photo, Focus Tools, and Take Series. In the Take Series Tab, make sure that “Reduction” is set to “None”, and that “Automatically Save Photos” is selected. 
5. Access the AutoSave settings by clicking the “AutoSave” button in Take Series. Input your nights directory to the AutoSave Folder, change the starting number to 1, and add a filename prefix. In the advanced settings, there are many options regarding how to name different kinds of images. If not already set, Light and Flat frames should be set to “:f_:i” (it will save each image with information about the filter used, :f, and the image type, :i), and bias and light frames should be set to “:i”. You can add as many of these as you like. Before taking your flats, bias and lights, change into the proper sub folder. 
6. Once the CCD and mirrors are cooled, you want to take your biases. Press the “Remove Series” button until only one series remains. Set the Binning to 2x2 and set the Frame to Bias. Set “Repeat Executes” to “Per Series” and then press “Take Series”. 
7. During twilight, your sky flats can be taken. In the Focus Tools tab, make sure that “Autosave Focus Photos” is NOT selected. Set the Frame to Flat Field, open the dome shutter, and point the telescope towards the sky. Flats need to be taken through each filter, starting with Blue, then Visual (Green), then Red. In your first filter, take images in the Focus Tools tab, and then adjust the exposure until your counts are between 25,000 and 35,000. Refer to the log book for the correct focus point for your current filter (it might be the same for all filters), and change the focus of the telescope by entering that number into Target and Goto in the Focus tab of PWI. Once you know your exposure time, go into the Take Series tab, set your exposure time and filter, set Frame to FlatField, and take your flats. This process needs to be repeated for each filter you will be using. 
8. Now we need to switch over to MaxIm DL to focus. Disconnect the camera from TheSkyX, and open MaxIm. Open the Camera Control Window (Ctrl + W), and go into the Setup tab. Connect the SBIG Universal camera, and the SBIG Universal filter in Camera 1. In the Cooler menu, set the temperature to the same temperature that it was cooled to in TheSkyX. Set coolers to "On" to start the temperature control. 
9. In the Expose tab, set the Frame Type to Light, put the camera in continuous shoot mode, and select your first filter. Slew the telescope to a 2nd magnitude or dimmer star, and set an exposure so that the CCD isn't over exposed. 
10. In the "Focus" tab of PWI, the current position of the focuser (in microns) is displayed near the top. This position will be changed to focus the telescope. If you know roughly where the focus point is, move the focuser to that position, just like you did when taking flats. If you don't know where the focus point is (or if the telescope is out of focus at the position entered), start exposing images on MaxIm, and use the In and Out buttons to get the star(s) in the image as small as possible. 
11. Once the focuser is roughly in the right position, let PWI's autofocus take care of the rest. Set Images to 5, Spacing to 500, Exp Length to the same exposure length as in MaxIm, select 2x2 binning and Start autofocus. PWI will now take 5 images around your focus point, each with different focus points separated by 500 microns, and determine where your ideal focus point is. It will then automatically input this value into Position. Repeat this process for every filter you will be using, taking note of the position determined by PWI in the Log Book so they can be used during the night. There is a range of a few hundred microns where changes in the position of the focuser will not produce a noticeable change to the focus, making it possible to image through all or some filters with the same focuser position. Try to find this position, as using one focus point as opposed to two or three makes life easier. Once you find this point move to it, and note it in the Log Book. 
12. Disconnect from MaxIm and reconnect the to TheSkyX using the same procedure outlined before (remember to set Autosave to the correct folder). 
13. Slew the telescope to your target. In Focus Tools, set a low exposure length (a few seconds) and use the joystick on the lowest setting (0.05 deg/s) to center your object. 
14. Still in Focus Tools, determine the proper exposure time for your images in each filter, making sure no stars “bloom”. 
15. If each filter requires a different focus point, you will have to take different series of images individually, changing the focus point for every filter. To do this, go into the Take Series tab, and set Frame to Light, select your first filter, set binning to 2x2, and set the exposure time and series length, then take series. Once this is complete, change the focuser position in PWI, and take a series in your next filter. Repeat as needed. If you can image your object with the same focuser position in all filters, then you can set up several different series to be taken automatically. Press the “Add Series” button until you have as many series as you do filters you will be using. In each one, set your filter, binning, exposure and series length, then take series. This will take a series of images in each filter, switching them automatically. 
16. Check the position of the dome through the night to make sure the telescope is pointing out of the dome. 
17. Once you are done for the night, make sure you obtain a backup copy of your images. 
## Shutting Down 
1. To park the telescope, go into the Mount tab of PWI, click Commands, and Go to Park 
Position. 
2. If using the CCD, exit from its control program (The Sky X or MaximDL) and thenturn off 
the CCD. 
3. Next, turn off the fans. Disable the Focuser and Derotator in the Rotate and Focus tabs 
of PWI. Once the Derotator is disconnected, manually move (slowly) the Derotator so that the CCD is level. 
4. Open Plane Wave Shutter Control and close the mirror covers. Put the covers on the 
secondary and tertiary mirror, paying special attention not to touch the secondary mirror with the cover. 
5. Disconnect the telescope in the Mount tab of PWI, and turn off the telescope. 
6. Close the dome.
