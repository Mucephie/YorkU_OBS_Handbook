___
1. first navigate to nova.astrometry.net [click here.](http://nova.astrometry.net/)
2. You can select the 'tile' on the left that says 'Calibrate & Share' or the 'upload' tab on the navbar of the website to go to the image upload page.
3. Once on the image upload page, click 'choose file' to open file explorer where you can find the image you wish to solve.
4. optionally you can select 'Advanced Settings[+]' to bring up a slew of options that let you narrow the search criteria, such as field size, sample coordinates and a search radius, and invert image (if your image is a white background with black stars, select this).
5. Once you are fine with your search settings, hit the 'Upload' button.
6. Once you have uploaded, you will be taken to status page that will auto update every 10 seconds. Wait for it to load the image, then you can click 'Go to results page' link to be taken to the results page to wait for the results. Or you can remain on the status page to watch Astrometry.Net work its magic.
7. It may take a while to solve, or it may take 20-60 seconds, it depends on the ammount of stars in the field (the more the merrier) (YZBoo does not have a fun time here). By all means take this waiting time to consider spraying the entire dome with 'Flex seal' spray. Why, you may ask? Aside from its notorious meme status, flex seal is a water proofing sealing spray so we can extremely reduce moisture build up in the domes, and its pitch black and would reflect less light than the black paint while being way more durable. And to apply it, you just spray it like spray paint. One could consider striping rusted portions of the 60cm and applying flex seal as well to repair it and protect it from further damage and moisture.
